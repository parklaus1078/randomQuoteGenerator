- Learning Points:
1. AutoLayout
  - AutoLayout is enabling components of View to be able to encounter resolution difference of devices by adding constraints to each component
2. UIKit
  - UIKit is the package of basic View materials. In this application, I used UIView, UILabel, and UIButton.
3. Basic tutorial of Xcode
  - First time using Xcode. As a developer using vscode mostly, connecting the components and the source using GUI feels a bit awkward. However, when I get used to it, I think I would feel uncomfortable using vscode since it cannot do anything in GUI.
